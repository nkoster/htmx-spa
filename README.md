## HTMX Single Page Application

This repository hosts a Go-based server application that serves as a skeleton/example application for dynamically serving HTML content based on URL paths. Utilizing the HTMX library to enhance interactivity without requiring full page reloads, it supports both frontend and backend routing with full history support to ensure seamless user navigation and state management. You can use this code as a base for new full-stack SPA projects, especially when youâ€™re tired of dealing with insane JS dependency crap, like in React/Next.js projects, for example.

### Project Structure

- `ui/`: Contains the `index.html` file that serves as the base layout for all pages.
- `templates/`: Holds HTML files (`home.html`, `page_a.html`, `page_b.html`) that are dynamically loaded into the base layout based on the URL.
- `static/`: Directory for static files such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files.

### Features

- **Dynamic Content Loading**: Dynamically inserts content from the `templates/` directory into the `index.html` layout depending on the URL path accessed.
- **HTMX Integration**: Utilizes `htmx` for dynamic interactions, allowing for partial page updates and enhancing user experience with minimal overhead.
- **Routing and Browser History**: Supports frontend and backend routing that integrates seamlessly with browser history, ensuring smooth navigation and a robust UX.
- **Static File Serving**: Efficiently manages and serves static resources from the `static/` directory under the `/static/` URL path.

### How It Works

1. **Base HTML Serving**:
   - The root URL (`/`) serves the `index.html` file along with the `home.html` content integrated, providing the initial page layout and content.

2. **Dynamic Template Insertion**:
   - `/page_a.html` loads `index.html` with the content from `page_a.html`.
   - `/page_b.html` loads `index.html` with the content from `page_b.html`.

3. **Static Content**:
   - Accessible under `/static/`, allowing images, CSS, and JS to be loaded as needed.
